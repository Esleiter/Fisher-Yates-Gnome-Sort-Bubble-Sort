# Fisher-Yates-Gnome-Sort-Bubble-Sort
This code will generate a random list, display it before sorting it, then apply the Gnome Sort algorithm and display the list sorted by that algorithm. It will then generate a random list again, apply the Bubble Sort algorithm, and display the list sorted by that algorithm.
